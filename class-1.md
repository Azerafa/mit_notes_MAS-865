# Class  1

I actually wanted to start with the prototyping class before jumping into the prototyping of prototyping machines class. But alas that course doesn't seem to have recorded lectures posted and this one does, and it seems a lot less intimidating to start here so I can watch and feel more like I'm attending a real time lecture!&#x20;



I quickly realized this was a mistake as the prototyping class is required before you can take this one and for good reason, so I did some digging and found the 2020 videos from that class - so I will start there and once finished report back here! LOL!&#x20;
